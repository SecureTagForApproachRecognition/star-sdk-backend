\section{Introduction}
This serves as a technical overview of the sdk-backend, with requests and all models. Where possible we provide examples on how the payload could look like. The clients should take this document resp. the swagger file as a reference. The Swagger-File can be update during builds and hence is easy to maintain.

The specification is not yet finalized. Any feedback is welcome!
